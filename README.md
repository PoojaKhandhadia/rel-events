Welcome to the `rel-events` github repo!

`rel-events` is an awesome events library for react. It uses `redux` behind the scenes to offer a more convenient, simple and relevant API for dealing with data flows.

To get to know how it works, take a look at our [getting started guide](https://github.com/labcodes/rel-events/tree/master/docs/2-Getting-Started.md).

And if you want to dive right in, run `npm install --save rel-events` and hack away! :)

### Contributing

Don't hesitate to open an issue for bugs!

But if you would like a new feature, it would be nice to discuss it before accepting PRs. We reserve ourselves the right to reject a feature that was not discussed or that will impact the code or API in a meaningful way. In that case, open an issue so we can discuss it thoroughly. Thanks. <3
